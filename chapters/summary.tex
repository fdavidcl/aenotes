\chapter{Summary of published results}
\label{ch:summary}

This part of the document reproduces five articles published in peer-reviewed journals authored by the candidate. They represent the core contributions of the present thesis. However, there are many more outcomes resulting from the research work produced during the course of the doctoral studies. These include other journal articles co-authored in collaboration with other colleagues in tangential topics, national and international conferences, disseminative talks in seminars, several software libraries and one book. \autoref{fig:dashboard} indicates the main numbers related to the different types of works developed.

\subsection{Main articles}

From the works previously mentioned, five peer-review articles have been selected as the main core of this thesis for advancing our fundamental objectives.

The first objective, as described previously in \autoref{sec:objectives}, was to study autoencoders and contribute to more people being able to use them to solve their tasks. \autoref{ch:paper1} addresses this by describing autoencoder fundamentals, its variants, implementations and providing tips on autoencoder design depending on the problem at hand.

Continuing with the objective of facilitating access to autoencoders, \autoref{ch:paper2} presents Ruta, a software library which simplifies the creation and training process. It is programmed in the R language to ease the transition from other tools for users with little programming knowledge.

Next, part of the time was devoted to exploring a diverse range of problems where autoencoders could be applicable. \autoref{ch:paper3} organizes the knowledge around a variety of supervised problems, for example, multi-instance classification and multi-output regression. For its part, \autoref{ch:paper5} analyzes another list of problems, mostly unsupervised, where autoencoder-based models have already been applied as a valid solution, from anomaly detection to instance generation.

Some preliminary work was accomplished into approaching one of the nonstandard supervised problems, label distribution learning, using an autoencoder-based solution. This did not improve on current, simpler techniques so our focus changed onto tackling a more general situation that could be then applied to multiple supervised problems. This new development, consisting of a model which is able to extract features with better class separability than most traditional feature learners, is detailed in \autoref{ch:paper6}. We also demonstrate the usefulness of this novel solution by applying it to a specific problem, detection of COVID-related pulmonar symptoms in X-ray images, in \sidecite{charte2021slicer}.
